# gumtreescraper
Scraping script to collect desired content from Gumtree.co.za

## Purpose
Purely accademical. I'd like to see if I can get data together on rentals in my suburb.
In doing so I'm hopeing to have a better idea of what I could ask a potential future tenant.

## Current Status
I've invested a bit of time and have extracted the first page of search results for rentals.
I'm quite preocupied now.(04/09/2019) Consequently I may not find the time to work on this script.
Not abandoned but definitly slow going.
